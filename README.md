# Pricing Perception in the Canadian Grocery Retail Industry

## 📊 Project Overview
This project explores how consumers perceive prices across various grocery retail banners in Canada, focusing on Metro and its competitor, Food Basics. Our research dives into the "how," "when," and "where" of price perceptions and the factors shaping consumer behavior.

## 📚 Objectives
The main goals of this study are to:
- Understand how, when, and where consumers form price perceptions about different retail banners.
- Identify strategies that drive customer satisfaction and create a favorable perception of price and value.
- Analyze the impact of advertising and promotional strategies, including flyers, on customer expectations and store choices.
- Investigate how ethnic, cultural, demographic, and geographic factors influence customer price expectations and store preferences.

## 🔍 Research Highlights
- **Market Overview:** Analyzed the Canadian grocery retail industry's market size, key players (Empire, Loblaws, Metro, Jim Pattison Group), and trends.
- **Company Analysis:** Detailed study of Metro’s business model, operations, and SWOT analysis.
- **Consumer Behavior:** Explored how income levels, age groups, and education influence grocery shopping habits.
- **Price Perception:** Compared Metro and Food Basics on perceived price index, pricing power, and profit risk.
- **Promotional Strategies:** Assessed Metro’s loyalty programs (MOI vs. PC Optimum) and digital presence, with recommendations for improvement.

## 📈 Methodology
Our analysis was conducted using:
- **Excel:** Used for data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualizations (pivot tables, charts, and trend lines).
- **Secondary Data:** Reports from Statista, Vividata, and official Metro financial records.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Benchmarking Metro against Food Basics using price perception and market share data.

## 📊 Key Findings
- Metro’s perceived higher prices align with its premium brand image but risk alienating price-sensitive consumers.
- Food Basics appeals to cost-conscious shoppers, but struggles with brand differentiation.
- Metro's MOI loyalty program lags behind PC Optimum, especially among younger shoppers.

## ✅ Recommendations
1. **Enhance Loyalty Programs:** Improve the MOI program by increasing point rewards and offering exclusive deals.
2. **Strengthen Digital Presence:** Expand Metro’s online shopping coverage and improve app functionality.
3. **Targeted Marketing:** Tailor campaigns to highlight Metro’s eco-conscious efforts and Food Basics' affordability.
4. **Regional Customization:** Adapt promotions based on regional preferences — urban vs. suburban shoppers.
